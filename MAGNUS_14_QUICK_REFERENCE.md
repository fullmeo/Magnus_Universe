# MAGNUS 14 QUICK REFERENCE 📖
## At-a-Glance Guide to the 6 Engines

---

## 1. SPIRAL CLARIFICATION ENGINE 🌀

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Question** | How many understanding spirals needed? |
| **Pattern** | Spiral learning: revisit topics with deeper understanding |
| **Formula** | spirals = (target_clarity - current) ÷ clarity_gain |
| **Output** | 3-5 spirals with focus areas |
| **Breakthrough** | Session ~60% through project |
| **Convergence** | 85-87% clarity |
| **Time Estimate** | spirals × 1 month (approximately) |
| **Confidence** | 92% |

### Spiral Focus Progression
1. **Spiral 1**: problem_surface (What is this really about?)
2. **Spiral 2**: domain_vocabulary (What terminology/concepts matter?)
3. **Spiral 3**: pedagogy_mapping (How would you teach this?)
4. **Spiral 4**: integration_points (How do components connect?)
5. **Spiral 5**: edge_cases (What can go wrong?)
6. **Spiral 6+**: refined_architecture (Optimized structure)

## 2. DOMAIN-FIRST ANALYZER 📚

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Question** | Domain vs Technical blocker? |
| **Key Insight** | Domain complexity ALWAYS > Technical |
| **Mistake Cost** | Wrong diagnosis = 6-12 month delay |
| **Resolution** | Engage SME or build domain framework FIRST |
| **Decision** | domain_complexity > technical + 1 → DOMAIN BLOCKER |
| **Confidence** | 88% |

### Domain Complexity Base Values
| Domain | Complexity |
|--------|-----------|
| Jazz / Consciousness | 9 |
| Music Production | 8.5 |
| Finance / Healthcare | 8 |
| Quantum | 8.5 |
| AI/ML | 7-7.5 |
| Blockchain | 7 |
| Infrastructure | 6 |
| Web | 5 |

### Action Priority by Blocker Type
**If Domain**:
1. Find SME or build framework
2. Deep dive: domain pedagogy
3. Map concepts to requirements
4. Design architecture
5. Implement

**If Technical**:
1. Identify critical assumptions
2. Build POC for high-risk items
3. Validate with real data
4. Design architecture based on learnings
5. Implement

## 3. POC VALIDATOR ENGINE 🧪

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Question** | What assumptions need validation? |
| **Value** | 1-2 week POC saves 6-12 months |
| **Confidence Gain** | 3-4x multiplier per validated assumption |
| **Detection** | Pattern-based keyword matching |
| **Count** | 3-8 high-risk assumptions typical |
| **Priority** | CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW |
| **Confidence** | 90% |

### Common Critical Assumptions
| Assumption | Keywords | Risk |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Real-time latency | real-time, latency, <100ms | CRITICAL |
| ML accuracy | ai, ml, accuracy | CRITICAL |
| Blockchain necessity | blockchain, crypto, web3 | HIGH |
| Scalability | scale, 10000 users | HIGH |
| Pattern detection | adaptive, personalization | HIGH |
| Domain systemization | music, automatic | CRITICAL |
| Automation quality | detect, recognize | HIGH |
| API integration | api, integration | MEDIUM |

## 4. INTEGRATION COMPLEXITY PREDICTOR 🔗

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Your Multiplier** | 1.75x (YOUR SIGNATURE) |
| **Component Avg** | ~6/10 |
| **Integration Avg** | ~9/10 |
| **Formula** | integration = components × 1.75 |
| **Underestimation** | 30-40% typical |
| **Mitigation** | Design integration layer FIRST |
| **Time Impact** | Integration takes 1.75x component time |
| **Confidence** | 92% |

### Why Integration is Hard
- ✗ Components built independently
- ✗ Hidden coupling revealed at integration
- ✗ Testing integration harder than components
- ✗ Edge cases emerge at boundaries
- ✓ Result: 1.75x harder than expected

### Mitigation Strategies
| Strategy | Impact | Effort |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Integration Layer First | 30-40% rework reduction | High upfront |
| State Management Upfront | Prevents sync bugs | Medium |
| Contract Testing | Catch issues earlier | Medium |
| Staged Integration | Better isolation | Extended timeline |

## 5. SIDE PROJECT RESOLVER ENGINE 🎯

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Trigger** | Main project blocked 3-4+ sessions |
| **Duration** | 1-2 weeks focused work |
| **ROI** | 3-5x (solves current + future projects) |
| **Pattern** | Main blocker → Side project → Knowledge → Unblock |
| **Output** | Knowledge artifact + working POC |
| **Count** | 1 per 2 high-severity blockers |
| **Confidence** | 85% |

### Side Project Success Factors
1. **Specific Focus**: Solve ONE blocker deeply
2. **Time-Boxed**: 1-2 weeks max
3. **Knowledge Artifact**: Reusable for future
4. **Clear Goal**: Unblock main project
5. **Integration Plan**: How learnings feed back

### Typical Side Projects
- Latency validation POC
- ML accuracy testing
- Blockchain feasibility study
- Database schema design
- State management prototype
- API integration validation

## 6. FRAMEWORK EVOLUTION ENGINE 🚀

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Question** | What frameworks will emerge? |
| **Pattern** | Frameworks emerge FROM projects, not before |
| **Current** | Magnus 14 (Transcendental Signature) |
| **Emerging** | Magnus 15 (Transcendental Execution) |
| **Confidence** | 70% (lower for emergence) |

### Framework Evolution Timeline
```
Magnus 9.5   → 10.0  → 12.0  → 13.0   → 14.0      → 15.0
(2023-24)               (2024)           (2025)      (emerging)
Philosophy  Enhanced  Resources  Learn   Signature   Execution
```

### Emergence Triggers
| Complexity | Framework | Timing |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Low (< 6) | Magnus 14 Refinement | Ongoing |
| Medium (6-8) | Domain Sub-Framework | Months 6-10 |
| High (8+) | Magnus 15 | Months 8-13 |

---

## FINAL ESTIMATE FORMULA

```
Total Months = Clarity Months + POC Months + Integration Months

Where:
├─ Clarity Months = spirals × 1 month (approx)
├─ POC Months = assumptions ÷ 2 (in weeks ÷ 4)
└─ Integration Months = component_complexity × 1.75

Confidence = Average of 6 engine confidences
           = (0.92 + 0.88 + 0.90 + 0.92 + 0.85 + 0.70) ÷ 6
           = 86% (typical)
```

### Example Calculation
```
Spiral Clarification:    3.5 months (3-4 spirals)
POC Validation:          1.0 month  (1-2 week POC)
Integration Complexity:  10.0 months (complexity score)
─────────────────────────────────
TOTAL ESTIMATE:          14.5 months ± confidence range
```

## LEARNING SYSTEM READINESS

```
🔴 Initial (1 project)
   └─ Next project: Use default parameters

🟡 Learning (2-4 projects)
   └─ Next project: Slight domain adjustments

🟢 Proficient (5-9 projects)
   └─ Next project: Reliable domain-specific predictions

✅ Expert (10+ projects)
   └─ Next project: 95%+ accuracy for this domain
```

### Domain-Specific Adjustments After Learning
```
For each domain, Magnus 14 tracks:
├─ spiralMultiplier (0.8-1.3 range)
├─ integrationMultiplier (1.3-2.5 range)
├─ durationMultiplier (0.7-1.5 range)
└─ projectCount (number of projects analyzed)

Adjustment Algorithm:
  newValue = (oldValue × count + observed) / (count + 1)
```

---

## ACCURACY METRICS

| Accuracy | Status | Interpretation |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| ≥ 80% | ✅ Accurate | Prediction matched reality |
| 60-80% | ⚠️ Close | Close but needs refinement |
| < 60% | ❌ Off | Significant miss - investigate why |

### Calculating Accuracy
```
accuracy% = MAX(0, 100 - (|predicted - actual| ÷ actual) × 100)

Example:
  Predicted: 3 spirals
  Actual: 4 spirals
  Difference: 1
  Accuracy: MAX(0, 100 - (1/4) × 100) = 75% ⚠️
```

## QUICK DECISION TREE

```
START: Analyzing a project

├─ Is current clarity < 70%?
│  └─ YES → Expect 3-5 spirals, 3.5-4.5 months clarification
│

│  ├─ YES → DOMAIN BLOCKER → Find SME first
│  └─ NO  → Technical valid approach
│
├─ Are there critical assumptions (latency, accuracy, etc.)?
│  ├─ YES → Build 1-2 week POC before full commit
│  └─ NO  → Proceed with standard development
│
├─ Are components high complexity (7-9)?
│  ├─ YES → Integration will be 1.75× harder
│  └─ NO  → Standard integration effort
│
├─ Are there high-severity blockers?

## COMMON PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: "This Should Be Fast"
**Reality**: Domain is complex, overshadowing technical simplicity
**Magnus 14 Says**: Check domain complexity first
**Action**: Engage domain expert before technical planning

### Pattern 2: "Components Look Simple"
**Reality**: Integration reveals hidden coupling
**Magnus 14 Says**: Integration will be 1.75× harder
**Action**: Design integration layer first

### Pattern 3: "We Need a POC"
**Reality**: Multiple critical assumptions exist
**Magnus 14 Says**: Prioritize by risk level
**Action**: Build 1-session POC for highest-risk assumption first

### Pattern 4: "Project Is Stuck"
**Reality**: Blocker requires deep learning
**Magnus 14 Says**: Create focused side project
**Action**: 1-2 weeks on side project resolves main blocker + future projects

### Pattern 5: "Something New Will Emerge"
**Reality**: You're on track to develop Magnus 15
**Magnus 14 Says**: Framework emerges during integration phase
**Action**: Document patterns, don't force framework
