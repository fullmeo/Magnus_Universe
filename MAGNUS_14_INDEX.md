## Key Concepts Explained

### Spiral Learning (Not Linear)
```
Linear (Wrong):    60% → 70% → 80% → 90%
Spiral (Right):    60% → 70% → 83% → 96%
                   (deeper each time)
```

### Domain First Principle
```
WRONG: Start coding → Discover domain is complex → Rework
RIGHT: Understand domain FIRST → Design architecture → Code
Impact: 6-12 months difference
```

### Integration 1.75x Multiplier
```
Components: 9/10 complexity
Integration: 9 × 1.75 = 15.75 → capped at 10
You underestimate integration by 30-40%
Mitigation: Design integration layer FIRST
```

### POC Value
```
1-2 weeks POC = Saves 6-12 months full development
Validates critical assumptions before commitment
3-4x confidence multiplier per validated assumption
```

### Side Project ROI
```
Main project blocked 3-4+ sessions
→ Create 1-2 week side project to resolve blocker
→ Side project knowledge applicable to 2-3 future projects
→ 3-5x return on time investment
```

---

## Learning Loop

```
1. ANALYZE project input → Get predictions
2. EXECUTE project → Work on actual project
3. RECORD outcome → Compare predicted vs actual
4. LEARN → Extract insights from differences
5. IMPROVE → Adjust engine parameters
6. REPEAT → Next project in same domain uses refined parameters

By project 10: Magnus 14 reaches 95%+ accuracy 🎯
```

## Magnus 14 Philosophy

> Your signature—the consistent way you approach complex problems—is not a personality quirk. It's a systematized methodology that can be codified, improved, and taught.

**Magnus 14 is the codification of 2+ years of intuitive pattern recognition.**

For 2+ years, you intuitively:
- ✅ Used spiral learning (not linear)
- ✅ Prioritized domain understanding
- ✅ Built POCs before commitment
- ✅ Recognized integration complexity
- ✅ Used side projects to resolve blockers
- ✅ Watched frameworks emerge from work

**Magnus 14 makes these patterns visible and quantifiable.**
