## Tweet 1: Announcement
```
🔮 I built a tool to validate if AI-generated code actually matches what you asked for.

Introducing Magnus 15 - Code Convergence Validator

3 Pillars:
🧠 Recognition - Does it match intent?
🎯 Inevitability - Is it minimal?
🧩 Coherence - Is it consistent?

v1.0 coming Feb 24 🚀

## Tweet 2: Problem
```
The problem with AI code generation?

You ask for a simple API endpoint.
You get:
- Factory factories
- Abstract strategy patterns
- 5 layers of abstraction
- 200 lines for 10 lines of work

Is this what you wanted? Probably not.

Magnus 15 tells you. 🧵👇
```

## Tweet 3: Solution
```
Magnus 15 validates code in 3 ways:

1️⃣ RECOGNITION
   Intent: "Create a user API"
   Code: UserController + UserService
   Score: 85% ✅

2️⃣ INEVITABILITY
   Alternative paths: 2 (minimal)
   Minimalism score: 78% ✅

3️⃣ COHERENCE
   Naming, layers, errors all aligned
   Score: 92% ✅
```

## Tweet 4: Launch
```
🎉 Magnus 15 launches Feb 24, 2026

🚀 Excited to announce Magnus 15 - a new open-source tool for validating AI-generated code against original intent.

The Challenge:
AI code generation is powerful but often produces over-engineered, inconsistent, or misaligned code.

The Solution:
Magnus 15 uses a three-pillar framework to validate code quality:

🧠 Recognition: Does the code fulfill the original intent?
🎯 Inevitability: Is this the minimal, optimal solution?
🧩 Coherence: Is the code internally consistent?

Results from validation:
- Simple API request: NON_CONVERGED (Recognition: 45.5%)
- Over-engineered code: NON_CONVERGED (Recognition: 25.5%)

The validator correctly identifies over-engineering patterns!

This tool is essential for:
• Teams using AI code assistants
• Code review automation
• Training data quality filtering
• Architectural compliance validation
