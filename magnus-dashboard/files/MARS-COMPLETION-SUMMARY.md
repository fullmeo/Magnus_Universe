## The Game Changer Delivered

### Before MARS ❌
- You ask Claude for things
- Each project starts from zero
- Learnings dormant
- You do strategic thinking
- Framework is static

### After MARS ✅
- Claude asks YOU questions
- Each project builds on all past projects
- Learnings actively improve framework
- Claude does strategic thinking, you approve
- Framework improves continuously
- Exponential growth

### Example Output

When you run `await system.proposeNextResearch()`, Claude says:

```
Based on your last 2 projects, I've identified emerging patterns.

Here are the 3 most impactful research directions:

1. Sacred Geometry in Code Architecture
   Impact: High | Effort: 3-4 weeks | Fit: Excellent

2. Language Domain Bottleneck Library
   Impact: Medium | Effort: 2 weeks | Fit: Perfect

3. Pythagorean Harmony in System Design
   Impact: High | Effort: 4-6 weeks | Fit: Excellent

Which direction shall we explore?
Or would you like me to propose something different?
```

**This is autonomous. This is the game changer.**
